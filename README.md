# De-ning-Public-Scenes-from-Private-Using-MIT-Indoor67
 we mixed and matched several feature extraction methods and classiﬁers to separate public images from private ones. We compared the performance of image feature extraction tools, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), and VGG16. We also studied through several state-of-the-art classiﬁers, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Means, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF) to see which classiﬁer works best with which feature extraction tool. Index Terms—Indoor Scene Classiﬁcation, Transfer Learning, SIFT, CNN, VGG16, SVM
